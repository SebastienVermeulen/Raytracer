# Raytracer
Raytracer made using doc. from: "Raytracer in a weekend"

Just running one of the .exe's will do the trick.
I compiled versions of the program for both x64 and x86.
You can find them in the .zip's.

The program itself can be found in the "code" folder.
Do not that there is a .dll in all the release and debug folders,
this file the "SDL2.dll" is crusial if you want the program to run.
In other words make sure to not delete it.
